. DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS
2.1 Data Collection and Preparation
Data collection for the funnel analysis of Metrocar involved gathering relevant 
information from multiple sources. The primary data source was Metrocar's internal 
database which was accessed via SQL, it contained user interactions and activities 
captured within the mobile application. This included data points such as app downloads, 
user registrations, ride requests, driver acceptances, ride completion, payments, and user 
reviews
To ensure data accuracy and reliability, data cleansing and preprocessing techniques were 
applied. This involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and addressing any 
inconsistencies or anomalies present in the dataset. Additionally, data validation checks 
were performed to verify the integrity and quality of the collected data.

Funnel Analysis Pipeline
The funnel analysis pipeline was designed to examine the user journey through different 
stages of the Metrocar app, from app download to ride completion. The following steps 
were taken to analyze the funnel:
2.2.1 Define Funnel Stages: The various stages of the funnel, as outlined in the project 
background, were identified, and defined. These stages included app download, signup, 
request ride, driver acceptance, ride, payment, and review.
2.2.2 Calculate Conversion Rates: Conversion rates were calculated by measuring the 
proportion of users who successfully progressed from one stage to the next. This allowed 
for a comprehensive understanding of the user drop-off points within the funnel
2.2.3 Identify Key Metrics: Key metrics were selected to assess the performance and 
effectiveness of each funnel stage. These metrics included the number of app downloads, 
signup completion rate, ride request acceptance rate, ride completion rate, payment 
success rate, and review submission rate.
2.2.4 Visualize Funnel Performance: Visualizations such as funnel charts, bar graphs, 
and line plots were utilized to visually represent the funnel performance. These 
visualizations provided a clear overview of user flow, highlighting areas of improvement 
and potential bottlenecks.
2.2.5 Analyze Funnel Conversion: The conversion rates and key metrics were analyzed 
to identify critical drop-off points in the funnel. By pinpointing stages with lower 
conversion rates, insights were gained into potential barriers or user experience issues that 
hindered successful progression.

 KEY FINDINGS AND INSIGHTS
3.1 Overall Funnel Performance
During the funnel analysis of Metrocar, several key findings emerged regarding the overall 
performance of the user conversion process. These findings shed light on the effectiveness 
of each stage within the funnel and provided insights into the user journey. The following 
are the key findings:
3.1.1 High App Download Rate: Metrocar experienced a substantial number of app 
downloads, indicating a strong initial interest in the service.
3.1.2 Conversion Rate Drop-offs: Despite the high number of app downloads, a 
significant drop-off was observed during the signup stage. This suggests potential barriers 
or friction points in the registration process, requiring further investigation.
3.1.3 Ride Request and Driver Acceptance: The ride request and driver acceptance stage 
and the subsequent ride completion stage exhibited satisfactory conversion rates, 
indicating a smooth and efficient ride experience for users.
3.1.4 Rides Completed: There is a huge drop off from the driver acceptance to ride 
completion. This is a major red flag. There is a need for further investigation to find out 
why the users are not embarking or completing the rides. There could be many factors 
responsible for these bottlenecks and recommendations will be given based on the result 
of the findings.
3.1.5 Payment Success and Review Submission: Most users successfully completed the 
payment process, indicating a robust payment infrastructure within the app. Additionally, 
a significant portion of users provided ratings and reviews, reflecting a level of 
engagement and user feedback.
3.2. Identifying Critical Drop-off Points
Analyzing the funnel conversion rates helped identify critical drop-off points where users 
were most likely to abandon the conversion process. These points require careful 
attention and targeted improvement strategies. The key drop-off points identified are as follows:

1 Signup Stage: The signup stage experienced a notable drop-off in the conversion 
rate, suggesting potential user experience issues or friction during the registration process. 
Improving the registration flow, simplifying the required information, and streamlining 
the verification process could help reduce drop-offs and improve conversion.
3.2.2 Request Ride Stage: A moderate drop-off was observed during the request ride 
stage, indicating potential user hesitations or dissatisfaction with the ride selection 
process. Enhancing the user interface, providing clear instructions, and optimizing ride 
options could lead to a smoother experience and higher conversion rates.
3.2.3 Rides Completed: The greatest deep was experienced as this stage of the funnel. 
Users are requesting rides, drivers accepting these rides, but for some reasons the rides are 
not being completed. 
3.3 Insights from Rides Completed stage:
User Experience Issues: The drop-off at the "Rides Completed" stage suggests potential 
user experience issues during the actual ride itself. Users may be encountering difficulties 
or challenges that prevent them from completing their rides. It is crucial to identify and 
address these issues to improve the overall ride experience.
Driver Availability and Reliability: The incomplete rides could be attributed to driverrelated factors such as unavailability or delayed arrival. Users may be canceling or 
abandoning rides if drivers do not arrive within a reasonable timeframe. Ensuring a 
sufficient number of active and reliable drivers can help mitigate this issue.
Communication and Coordination Problems: Incomplete rides could be a result of 
miscommunication or coordination problems between drivers and riders. If users face 
difficulties in communicating their pickup locations or if drivers struggle to locate riders 
accurately, it can lead to ride cancellations. Improving communication channels and 
providing clearer instructions for both drivers and riders can help minimize such issues.
3.4 Insights by Platform and Age Group
Further analysis provided insights based on different platforms (iOS, Android, and web) 
and age groups. These insights can inform targeted strategies and resource allocation. The 
key findings and insights include:

3.4.1 Platform Insights:
iOS: The iOS platform demonstrated a higher conversion rate compared to Android and 
web platforms. Allocating marketing budget and resources towards iOS user acquisition 
and retention could yield favourable results.
Android: Android users exhibited a slightly higher conversion rate compared to web. 
Focusing on optimizing the user experience and addressing platform-specific challenges 
can help improve conversion.
Web: The web platform showed potential for growth, but conversion rates were relatively 
lower compared to mobile platforms. Investing in web platform enhancements, such as 
responsive design and improved functionality, could attract and convert more users.
3.3.2 Age Group Insights

Young Adults: Users in the young adult age group (18-30 years) demonstrated higher 
conversion rates across multiple funnel stages. Targeted marketing efforts towards this 
age group can yield better results.
 
Older Adults: Users in the older adult age group (45-54 years) showed lower conversion 
rates, indicating potential usability challenges. Improving accessibility and providing 
personalized support can help enhance the user experience for this demographic.
Un identified Age group: The highest concentration of users fell within this age group.
There should be a stricter way to ensure that the age groups are properly identified, either 
making this a compulsory field or transferring the information from other sources of 
customer information.
These key findings and insights provide valuable guidance for optimizing the Metrocar 
funnel, addressing critical drop-off points, and tailoring strategies based on platform and 
age group dynamics. By addressing these insights, Metrocar can enhance the user 
experience, increase conversion rates, and drive growth in the ride-hailing industry.
4.0. SURGE PRICING AND RIDE REQUESTS DISTRIBUTION
Insights:
Peak ride request times: Morning (7am-10am), afternoon (3pm-6pm), and a slight rise in 
the evening (7pm) indicate high-demand periods.
Supply-demand imbalance: During peak times, there may be more ride requests than 
available drivers, leading to longer wait times or unfulfilled requests.
Surge pricing opportunity: Implement surge pricing during peak hours to incentivize 
more drivers and balance supply and demand.
